Below are the file details mentioned and also the follow 

1. tensorflow2_steps.ipynb -  Training a custom object detection model
2. generate_tfrecord.py - Supporting for model training
3. model_inference.ipynb - After training, check the model inference
4. test_pred_with_csv_gen.ipynb - Creating a prediction csv, which helps for confusion matrix
5. confusion_martix_object_detection.py - Generate confusion matrix also precision and recall
6. labels_dict.txt - Supporting file for confusion_martix_object_detection 
7. bentoml_creation.ipynb - Creating a restapi and also docker image using "BentomL"
